# Artist Statement

My artwork has addressed the theme ‘fearful symmetry’ through an abstract interpretation of phobias. This interactive piece attempts to simulate various fears in an artistically symmetrical and engaging way.

The structure of this experience, is heavily dependent on the audience. The artistic experience is based on the viewers random selection. This element of mystery by selecting a box without knowing which phobia is to be simulated adds an emotional experience of uncertainty and creates an experience unique to the individual. The artistic decision to exclude the labelling of the phobias encourages the audience to interpret which fear is being represented. 

My project isn’t solely about making the viewer scared, the entirety of my project is  rather based on simulating and artistically representing phobias and common fears in an interactive and intriguing way, aligning with the fearful aspect of the theme. 

The symmetrical aspect of the theme, I believe, was heavily involved in this project. Each phobia I have is completely symmetrical. I have worked to not only form an interesting simulation, but also encouraged this artistic mirroring throughout the project. This has made my project more abstract and elusive which I think makes the piece more interesting to observe and experience. 

Breaking down the piece into its individual components, the claustrophobia piece, attempts to make the audience feel as if they are trapped inside a sphere. I created a 3D moveable sphere that pushes the viewer inside, creating a tight and inescapable space. 

Another phobia simulation was arachnophobia. This component heavily revolves around the web, a symbolic and symmetrical pattern. Once the web is fully formed, a spider emerges and follows the viewers mouse. This symbolically represents the predatorial characteristics of spiders and the fearful feelings of being chased. Once the spider reaches the viewers curser, spiders emerge from each corner of the web, the scuttling and fast movements creating discomfort. 

Furthermore, fear of heights was also simulated. This dramatic component, attempts to simulate a sense of being lifted then falling as the ‘buildings’ heights grow at various lengths. The shadowing adds dimension to further dramatizes the fearful sensation of falling. 

Another component includes fear of lightning. This slide is visually overwhelming and has a degree of intensity in an attempt to create a fearful, yet unpredictable art piece. 

Fear of the dark is also conveyed. The viewer clicks, symbolising turning on a light, which conceals any scary figures. The lights flicker and eventually turn off, causing blinking eyes to emerge.  

Fear of haunting and the supernatural is also portrayed. To keep the candles alight, the viewer must gently blow slightly lighting the room. Once the light is out however, an eerie, haunting audio plays, creating the effect of supernatural emergence in a chilling atmosphere. 

Fear of death is another aspect explored, with an artistic interpretation of a heart monitor, which requires the constant tapping of keys symbolically representing the beating of a heart. Once the viewer stops tapping, the monitor flatlines.
