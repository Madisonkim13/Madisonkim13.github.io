# Interaction Statement

The user will first see 5 white squares. When the mouse is being hovered, the square will shake encouraging the user to select a square. Upon clicking the mouse, the user will be transported into a simulation of a certain phobia. 

If user entered and observes a sphere, the screen will zoom automatically pushing the viewer inside. The viewers is then able to use the moues to turn any degree using the mouse and interactively observe the encapsulated environment, creating feelings of entrapment and claustrophobia. 

If user enters and observes 5 candles, the viewer should blow on their screens to keep the candle alight. Once the viewer stops, the candle and room light will dim. This will then trigger the eerie, haunting audio to play. 

If user enters and observes a web rapidly being woven, the user should wait until the animated spider appears and interactively avoid it some trapping the users mouse. Upon reaching the mouse, this will trigger the movements of multiple spiders emerging from corners of the screen. 

If user enters and observes a flickering screen, the viewer must click to turn the lights on, once the screen grows dark eyes will emerge in darkness. 

If user enters and observes formation of multiple squares, the viewer should slide the mouse across the screen causing the ‘building’ to grow and shrink. 

If the user enters and observes a dark blue screen, the viewer must click causing unique lightning bolts to strike accompanied by light and audio. 

If the user enters and observes a dark screen with 3 coloured lines, the viewer must press a key, to prevent the heart monitor from flatlining. 

There are no instructions written throughout the whole piece. I wanted the art to be self-explanatory and I made certain interactive decisions to prompt the viewer. I wanted the wanted the piece to remain artistic and intentionally avoided written instructions to distinguish it from a ‘game’.
